## Learning

* [DIY HRT Directory](https://diyhrt.wiki/index) - Really great info. Nothing about how to make your own, but lots of surrounding info.
* [Transfem Science](https://transfemscience.org/) - huge round up for scientific literature about HRT
* [Injectable Estradiol Blood Level Simulator](https://transfemscience.org/misc/injectable-e2-simulator-advanced/)

## U.S. Compounding Standards
* [USP 797](https://college.acaai.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2019_USP_FINAL_2019-06-01.pdf) - If this is taken down you can just search "USP 797 pdf" and you should be able to find it. A revised version is slated to be published in Nov 2023.
* [Compounding Sterile Preparations](https://publications.ashp.org/display/book/9781585284856/9781585284856.xml) - by E. Clyde Buchanan. This book is very expensive, you can find a PDF on libgen and maybe sci-hub.

## Substance Testing
_These resources are not endorsed, merely linked_
* [Tox Associates](https://toxassociates.com/) - recommended by Boobs Not Bombs
* [Janoshik Analytical](https://janoshik.com/pricing/) - will test your vials. The steroid community seems to rely on them.


## Guides
_I do not endorse making vials with these guides, as they lack proper sterilization techniques. They are linked here to say "yes I know about these, proceed with caution"._
* [Ultimate DIY Guide](https://groups.io/g/MTFHRT/wiki/29602) - "Lena's Guide," often considered the "definitive" guide, it is recommended you use this information WITH EXTREME CAUTION. [This guide has NO adequate sterilization process](/other/lena), which is irresponsible, dangerous, and very likely speaks to other issues with the information. The author is known to be highly argumentative when facing criticisms about this guide and is even [banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/comments/11zuerc/comment/jdgehno/) from participating in the r/TransDIY subreddit. It is linked here for educational purposes. - [[Mar 10 '23 backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20230310170255/https://groups.io/g/MTFHRT/wiki/29602)]
* [Vials/Transdermal/Pills: HRT Homebrew](https://files.catbox.moe/ax9efj.pdf) - [[backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20220809114615/https://files.catbox.moe/ax9efj.pdf)]
* [Homebrewing testosterone (r/steroids)](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/homebrew/list/) - r/steroids has almost 200k members on reddit. They take their info seriously. I have not fully reviewed this info, but this will be a good source for info specific to brewing testosterone. There is an extremely significant overlap between brewing E and T, and this is likely a good resource.
* [Noire Labs Guide](https://noirelabs.net/diy-estradiol-guide) - I haven't read this all the way through yet. Has some good info but is vastly lacking in safety precautions. If you follow these instructions I believe it's irresponsible to give your vials away/sell them. - ([backup](https://ia802609.us.archive.org/18/items/noire-labs-diy-injectable-guide/Noire%20Labs%20-%20DIY%20injectable%20guide.pdf))
* [How to make estradiol stickies](https://stickies.neocities.org/stickies) - if you have limited resources and need to make your estradiol tablets last, this is a great method to look into. - [backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20230321182426/https://stickies.neocities.org/stickies)

## General

* [r/steroids Materials list](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/2tqv44/homebrew_discussion_on_a_larger_budget/)
* [Utah.edu sterilization info](https://teach.genetics.utah.edu/content/microbiology/liquids/) - good basics on sterilization of liquids [[backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20230131042428/https://teach.genetics.utah.edu/content/microbiology/liquids/)]
* [Sterilization Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/H9MBC8dG) - lots of great information and many resources linked at the bottom of the document - [[backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20221208222058/https://pastebin.com/H9MBC8dG)]
* [Reddit Instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/comments/g7etaq/feedback_for_homebrew_hrt_procedure/) - Has very helpful comments, especially regarding sterilization
* [Other Reddit Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/comments/fv86lk/homebrewing_hormones_mtf_guide/) - the main post was deleted, but useful comments
* [ISMP Guidelines for Safe Preparation of Compounded Sterile Preparations](https://www.ismp.org/sites/default/files/attachments/2017-11/Guidelines%20for%20Safe%20Preparation%20of%20Compounded%20Sterile%20Preperations_%20revised%202016.pdf)
* [Homebrewing Estrogel (Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/wiki/index/) - a good resource for how to make your own estrogel. Much of this info can be used to make T-gel as well. If you're not confident about your safety and sterilization practices with making vials, making gel is MUCH safer and can be as easy as mixing beta-estradiol and hand sanitizer in the right proportions.
* [Boobs Not Bombs Bulk Estrogel Guide](https://crimethinc.com/2022/12/15/producing-transdermal-estrogen-a-do-it-yourself-guide) - Very detailed guide on how to pool $2000 with some friends in order to make very large volumes of estrogel for your community. The information in this guide can be scaled down.
* [Boobs Not Bombs more materials](https://cryptpad.fr/drive/#/2/drive/view/isZDZxnR6gLfyvL94EdSYfypGFV1J3yD0oGOLk4cerU/)
* [TLC Purity Testing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/comments/v9ahfa/for_safetyrisk_reduction_a_basic_and_relatively/) - most viable DIY purity test at home. This link is merely a launching point. Read the dissenting comments... enough people raise safety concerns that I will advocate for laboratory testing.
* [Measuring air pressure in a syringe (demo)](https://www.edumedia-sciences.com/en/media/710-gas-in-a-syringe) - needed for bubble point testing w/o a pressure gauge
* [Measureing air pressure in a piston (syringe)](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Introductory_Chemistry/11%3A_Gases/11.04%3A_Boyles_Law_-_Pressure_and_Volume)
* [Boyle's Law Calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/boyles-law) - Use this to determine the pressure build up in your syringe when doing calculations for your bubble point test.

## Suppliers
* made-in-china.com - you can get a lot of various estradiol esters on here. I have seen T on here when searching by the CAS number of the ester. I would recommend searching around for info about the vendor on Google or Reddit to make sure that people have had good experiences with them before sending them your money.
* [Dragon Ordnance](https://www.dragonordnance.com/category?p=2&tid=32) - Considered a good supplier for raw materials with consistent quality. There are MANY reports about shipping issues. I do not endorse them, merely linking.
* For estradiol you can go to made-in-china.com and search for the CAS number of the substance you're looking for. I recommend finding someone online, in places like r/TransDIY, that can back up the reliability of your chosen source.
* For testosterone, getting raw powders is A LOT more difficult. Dragon Ordnance supplies them, and thats the only place I'm aware of. You can view steroidsourcetalk.cc for info about where body builders get their pre-made vials.
* If you're technically inclined, you can get on the dark web and probably find some raws on a marketplace, especially T. That is outside the scope of this guide, for now. https://tor.taxi/ has links to the various operating marketplaces. Make sure you check the PGP signatures of marketplaces against multiple sources before sending your money on there, use tails os, and try to stick to the monero cryptocurrency if you can.
* There are many more options. look at Reddit or https://diyhrt.cafe

## Unrelated
* [Four Thieves Vinegar Collective](https://fourthievesvinegar.org/) - Information about building devices and using hacks to take medical care into our own hands. MicroLab, ER Suite, Abortion Care, Tooth Seal.
* [GALAP: Gender Affirming Letter Access Project](https://thegalap.org/) - Connect with medical professionals in the US that will get you "informed consent" letters, looks like mostly for free.
* Sci-Hub: you can find most academic papers here without paywalls.

## Tech Resources
Wow it'd be great if this project was untraceable back to the creator. Here's what I'll be using for that.

* [Njalla Domain Registry](https://njal.la/) - based in the Caribbean and notorious for privacy practices.
* Monero - the standard for private crypto transactions.
* Protonmail - for needing a reliable yet privacy minded email service. This won't be on my phone.
* PGP encryption for as much communication as possible
* Signal when chatting friends about this
* Tails - I'm using the tails operating system on a burner laptop paid for in cash.
* ProtonVPN - when i'm not on tails I will be on protonvpn
* Mozilla Firefox - chrome is spying on you and brave is run by a bigot.
* I haven't decided how to host this guide yet. I'm toying with making a burner github account and using it for free hosing. There's also netlify or something similar. Since the services are free it should be fairly simply to use them anonymously. I really would like to make this a dapp and put it on the blockchain, but i'm not a crypto bro (or even a regular bro) so i don't have enough details to know how safe that is. It seems like once something is on the blockchain it's permanent, but there are all sorts of organizations who could suddenly start gatekeeping access to the blockchain.
