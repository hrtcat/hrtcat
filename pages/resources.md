## Learning

* [DIY HRT Directory](https://diyhrt.wiki/index) - Really great info. Nothing about how to make your own, but lots of surrounding info.
* [Transfem Science](https://transfemscience.org/) - huge round up for scientific literature about HRT
* [Injectable Estradiol Blood Level Simulator](https://transfemscience.org/misc/injectable-e2-simulator-advanced/)

## U.S. Compounding Standards
* [USP 797](https://college.acaai.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2019_USP_FINAL_2019-06-01.pdf) - If this is taken down you can just search "USP 797 pdf" and you should be able to find it. A revised version is slated to be published in Nov 2023.
* [Compounding Sterile Preparations](https://publications.ashp.org/display/book/9781585284856/9781585284856.xml) - by E. Clyde Buchanan. This book is very expensive, you can find a PDF on libgen and maybe sci-hub.

## Substance Testing
_These resources are not endorsed, merely linked_
* [Tox Associates](https://toxassociates.com/) - recommended by Boobs Not Bombs
* [Janoshik Analytical](https://janoshik.com/pricing/) - will test your vials. The steroid community seems to rely on them.


## Guides
_We do not endorse these guides. They are linked here for your edification. For critical analysis of other injectable guides see [Were My Vials Properly Sterilized?](/other/properly_sterilized)_
* [Vials/Transdermal/Pills: HRT Homebrew](https://files.catbox.moe/ax9efj.pdf) - [[backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20220809114615/https://files.catbox.moe/ax9efj.pdf)] - We haven't fully vetted these instructions, but considering this is the highest quality instructions for homebrewing HRT that we've seen, there may be merit to other information in here.
* [Homebrewing testosterone (r/steroids wiki)](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/homebrew/list/) - r/steroids has almost 200k members on reddit. They take their info seriously. We have not fully reviewed this info, but this will be a good source for info specific to brewing testosterone. There is an extremely significant overlap between brewing E and T, and this is likely a good resource.
* [How to make estradiol stickies](https://stickies.neocities.org/stickies) - if you have limited resources and need to make your estradiol tablets last, this may be worth looking into. - [backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20230321182426/https://stickies.neocities.org/stickies)
* [Reddit Instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/comments/g7etaq/feedback_for_homebrew_hrt_procedure/) - We haven't evaluated this guide, likely has issues.
* [Homebrewing Estrogel (Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/estrogel/wiki/index/) - A good resource for how to make your own estrogel, and can be adapted to make T gel. If you're not confident about your safety and sterilization practices with making vials, making topicals is MUCH safer and can be as easy as mixing beta-estradiol/testosterone base, orange essential oil, and hand sanitizer in the right proportions.
* [Boobs Not Bombs Bulk Estrogel Guide](https://crimethinc.com/2022/12/15/producing-transdermal-estrogen-a-do-it-yourself-guide) - Very detailed guide on how to pool $2000 with some friends in order to make very large volumes of estrogel for your community. The information in this guide can be scaled down.
