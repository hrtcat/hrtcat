# DIY Journal

Welcome to my journal where I write about ~~wild fantasies I have about catgirls~~ what I'm actively learning on any given day. Thoughts may be incomplete and scattered, these are merely my own notes. Look at [Topics](/topics) and [Guide](/guide) for more structured info.

## Reading Chapter 8
_May 13, 2023_

Build a clean room. The room needs to have high quality air filtration. Ideally this would be monitored but that seems unrealistic for DIY.

There needs to be a pressure differential between the clean room and the rest of your space. The differential isn't listed. Logically I think it just means you need to have air flowing OUT of the clean room, not in. This could be achieved as simply as having your air filter get intake from outside the room and push the clean air into the room. Differential is supposed to be monitored but that's unrealistic in DIY settings. Use simple tests such as dangling some string at the openings of the clean room to see that the airflow is blowing them out.

Recommended clean room temperature of 68F (20C) and humidity of 35-60%.

Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) 70% is the USPs primary recommendation on what to use as a disinfectant.

Info about Gowns and the order to put all garb on: pg127

> "All compounding personnel must successfully
complete an initial gloved fingertip/thumb sampling
procedure (zero colony-forming units) no less than
three times before they are allowed to compound
CSPs for human use (Chapter 28)"

## Reading Chapter 4
_May 12, 2023_

Because the bulk estradiol is going to arrive nonsterile the compounded sterile preparation (CSP) is considered "high risk".

Use USP 797 requirements for cleansing, garbing, cleaning, disinfecting, etc.

BUD = Beyond Use Date

Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) best practices recommend verifying contents of CSPs using 3rd party verification. I.e., send vials in for testing after production.

There are more standards than can ever be kept up with in a DIY situation. How to pick and choose?

Reading Chapter 4. Make sure to read Chapter 18 later.

Find "Batch Master Worksheets"

"Pre-sterilized sealed containers should be used when feasible" does this mean the final product should go from syringe through filter through needle and directly into a pre-sealed sterile vial? and then distribute with a single puncture hole already in it?

Must do a sterility test to verify safety of contents. See USP 71.

So much of the guidelines require certain standards as to where the drug is coming from. Obviously made-in-china.com is not on the list of approved suppliers lol.

**This chapter has more to offer and needs to be revisited.**

## Reading about sterility assurance
_May 11, 2023_

Chapter 17 of _Compounding Sterile Preparations_. I need to learn how to calculate the Sterility Assurance Level (SAL).

Filtration is important. Unless filtration is terminal filtration it cannot be assumed to create a sterile end product. **(What makes it terminal?)** An explanation of features needed in the syringe filter are listed in this chapter. Filters must be tested for integrity after they are used and results recorded. See CSP pg 252 for diagram.

Biological indicators must be used when sterilizing by heat to help ensure that the sterilization cycle was effective.

There is also info here about using steam and dry heat. Dry heat sterilizer using a static-air sterilizer (basically an oven) is not suitable for most materials. Use 338F for 60 mins, 320F for 120 mins, or 302F for 150 mins. I imagine if using a kitchen oven there should be a thermometer inside to verify temperatures.

Steam sterilization (autoclave) is considered terminal sterilization, it can be used to to sterilize the product and final container.It is the preferred method to sterilize aqueous solutions and suspensions that have been verified to maintain their chemical and physical stability under the required conditions. **How can I verify this with EEn or TEn?**

There is a formula that will let you determine temperature/time/pressure ratios.

D = decimal reduction time (minutes). time to reduce microbial population by 90%  
T = temperature  
Z = number of degrees of temp required to change D-value one log unit in time by a factor of 10. If D at 121C is 2 minutes, and the z-value is 10C, then D at 131C is 0.2 minutes. I get what this means but not really how to find the needed values.  
F<sub>0</sub> = idk?? it says this is a value but doesn't actually define it.

100 microbes in a solution, reduced by 1D, 10 microbes left.

Always document autoclave details per batch. Temp, pressure, chamber config, num articles sterilized.

A dry sealed container will not be sterilized by steam, a small amount of water must be within the container to sterilize interior. Most oils and powders can't be sterilized by steam as it may adversely affect the material.

Need to be able to verify the sterilization process was successful. How?

Use biological indicators containing _Geobacillus stearothermophilus_ (USP Chapter 1035) to help determine that sterilization is successful. See USP 71 for sterility tests.

**Primary takeaways**

* get the right filters
* autoclave at the right temp/pressure/time
* use biological indicator strips to verify sterility

## Getting Started
_May 10, 2023_

I'm going to use this page to document my "bathtub estradiol" project in hopefully fairly substantial depth. I have spent several months researching how to make DIY Estradiol Enanthate injectable vials, and I'm coming to the conclusion that there is no definitively *good* resource on how to do this. There is, however, a lot of information floating around. Most full blown guides are lacking a full explanation of why they're doing what they're doing, and additionally fail to hold themselves to what I consider adequate sterilization standards.

I am of the mind that if you are making vials for just yourself, and you make an informed decision to skip some sterilization procedures, then that is your right. However, it seems like most people who are making DIY vials do not have access to the right information for them to be making informed decisions around this. Worse then, when people use incomplete guides online to make HRT to distribute.

So, it is my goal to document my learning and brewing process in order to create a new standard for DIY guides. I will always be open to researched and referenced criticisms with the ultimate goal of creating the best open source guide we possibly can.

More to come.
