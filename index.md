Hiya! Welcome to HRT Cat. This is a website where you can review information on how to make injectable HRT, as well as a launching point for so many other types of necessary information about DIY HRT. It seems like every day the world becomes a scarier place for trans people. This website is dedicated to taking hormone therapy into our own hands when bigoted governments and institutions stand in our way. This website is open source, please feel free to [become a contributor](/pages/contribute) or to [make a donation](/pages/donate).

## Homebrewing HRT in the safest ways possible

Welcome the HRT Cat! This is a guide for homebrewing injectable estradiol and testosterone for yourself, for mutual aid, or for grey market resale. HRT Cat is open source and ready for contributions. We do not sell HRT, this guide is solely for the purposes of harm reduction in the trans community.

There is a lot of misinformation in the DIY injectables online community. This guide was thoroughly researched using a variety of scientific resources that are all cited throughout the guide. we have rigorously researched many commonplace claims about how to brew, and have either validated or refuted those claims.

We have done a deep dive into sterilization best practices when dealing with compounding what is called high-risk<sup>*</sup> preparations. Many of those practices cannot be completed in a home lab, but of the ones that are manageable we have written about them in the context of homebrewing. We hope that we can bring safe and necessary lab practices to people who are resorting to homebrewing, no matter the reason.

As far as we see it, given the state of the world, people in this community will be more and more forced into making their own hormones. And while there are options available for purchasing HRT online without a prescription, some people will opt to homebrew.

{: .warning }
Homebrewed vials will never be as safe as what can be achieved with proper training and tools. Homebrew vials should be a last resort. Consider making topicals. We provide this information because we believe homebrew is better than what happens when trans people are not given access to hormones.

## Where to start?

If you're ready to dive right in, take a look at the first guide, [Getting Started](/guides/1_getting_started).

If you have a specific question, you might try looking at the documented [topics](/topics) to see if there's any info you're looking for.

Otherwise, explore the links in the sidebar. We put things there.
