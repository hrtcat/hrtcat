## Homebrewing HRT in the safest ways possible

This guide takes a harm-reduction approach to homebrewing HRT injectables. While my primary focus is on Estradiol Enanthate I will attempt to be as inclusive towards Testosterone as I can. My base understanding is that brewing these two substances is a near identical process.

As far as I see it, given the state of the world people in this community will be more and more forced into making their own hormones. And while there are options available for purchasing HRT online without a prescription, some people will opt to follow existing guides on how to make their own vials and transdermals.

It is my belief that most known guides are flawed when it comes to sterilization and safety procedures. Therefore the goal of this guide is to, ultimately, be a gold standard of homebrewing procedures that balances safety and sterility alongside the practicalities and limilations of DIY. For example I will be using air filtration and a still air box, but I cannot afford to build a laminar flow hood.

{: .warning }
You should not brew your own HRT vials. You should not administer homebrewed HRT vials. The information on this website is not meant to replace the guidance of the USP or of medical/pharmacological professionals. Get your vials from a doctor. This is for educational purposes only. Proceed with caution.

## Where to start?

If you're ready to dive right in, take a look at the first guide, [Getting Started](/guides/1_getting_started).

If you have a specific question, you might try looking at the documented [topics](/topics) to see if there's any info you're looking for.

Otherwise, explore the links in the sidebar. I put things there.
