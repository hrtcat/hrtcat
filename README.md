HRT.cat aims to be the definitive resource on how to homebrew HRT vials. While many other guides exist, this one takes a keen interest in detail, documentation, references, and above all, sterilization practices. This is an essential harm reduction resource. Many people will make their own HRT no matter the information that they have on hand. This guide will help ensure that your home laboratory is creating as safe of an end product as possible.
