# Getting Started

The general recommendation I have after researching this topic in depth is that you shouldn't do this. I would go so far as to say that you should probably also avoid homebrew vials coming from even seemingly high quality sources unless you can learn about their quality assurance process.

## What to do instead

* Navigate the medical system lol
* View some un-vetted options on [Where to Buy HRT](/pages/ready-made)
* Checkout the [Additional Resources](/pages/resources) page for all sorts of links to other options
