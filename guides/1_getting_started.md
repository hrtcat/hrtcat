# Getting Started

The general recommendation I have after researching this topic in depth is that you shouldn't do this. I would go so far as to say that you should probably also avoid homebrew vials coming from even seemingly high quality sources unless you can learn about their quality assurance process. Stick with topicals or pharmaceutical grade preparations. 

## What you could do instead

* Navigate the medical system lol
* DIY topicals
* View some un-vetted options on [Where to Buy HRT](/pages/ready-made)
* Checkout the [Additional Resources](/pages/resources) page for all sorts of links to other options

## So...?

I feel confident in my ability to homebrew because of the independent research that I have conducted. I also understand that my vials will not be as safe as a vial coming out of a large manufacturer's lab. If you feel you can understand why we are doing what we're doing in this guide, and you have confidence in your ability to execute it properly, you will be the most protected. And remember the number one rule of ~~gun~~ lab safety: have fun!

## What this guide contains

From a high level this is what we'll be doing:

* Gathering supplies
* Building a clean room
* Sanitizing, sterilizing, and depyrogenating everything we can
* Mixing your preparation in a still air box or laminar flow hood
* Using a syringe filter to achieve terminal sterilization
* Seal your vials, conduct a bubble point test, and document everything you did.
