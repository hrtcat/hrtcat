# Mix Solution

Choose a recipe to brew, there are many options listed [here](/topics/recipe.md).

I use this:

I do not use a magnetic stirrer but that is an option instead of using a glass rod. Seems more useful if making gel.

Doing this all inside your still air box or laminar flow hood. Using proper sterilization technique. 

Measure out all the ingredients into a depyrogenated beaker or media bottle. They do not need to be added in any specific order. Mix them up with a glass stirring rod until the hormone powder is fully dissolved. If you are having trouble getting the powder into solution it is possible that you did not use enough benzyl benzoate. 


## If using heat 

Heat is not required to get your hormone powder to dissolve, especially when you're using benzyl benzoate in your mixture. However, the use of heat may accelerate the process of dissolving it, especially when making very high concentrations or leaving out BB. However, you risk it falling out of solution later with large temperature fluctuations. 

If using heat, try to do so in your clean room area. This could involve using a hot plate or bringing some near boiling water into the cleanroom and partially submerging your glass beaker with its mixture into it. Be ultra careful to not get water into your preparation.
