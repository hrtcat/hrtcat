# Wash and Sterilize Tools and Vials

#TODO finish this page

#TODO not depyrogenating at 500F anymore, too hot for the silicone septa. 

Now that you have a clean room that is more or less clean, you can start bringing your tools inside of it. [Wipe down everything with isopropyl alcohol 70%](/topics/alcohol_technique) before bringing it inside the room. This includes wiping down the outside of plastic bags, etc. You should be wearing gloves that you are frequently sanitizing with the isopropyl alcohol. The goal here is that everything in this room is clean and sanitized, so if your hands are dirty or your shoes are dirty etcetera then you are working against yourself and the final sterility of your vials.

Set up your laminar flow hood or your still air box, ensuring that you wipe down the whole thing with alcohol to sanitize before use. If you are using a laminar flow hood you can turn it on now so that you can begin circulating more filtered air through your clean room.

Preheat your oven to 500 degrees fahrenheit for depyrogenation.

Before you can depyrogenate your vials you need to wash them out to ensure that they are free from debris. I do this by dunking all of the vials it into a large pot of warm soapy water, shaking each vial underwater back and forth, and then rinsing well with cold water. Immediately start the depyrogenation process after rinsing

All glassware and vials must be [depyrogenated](/topics/sanitize_sterilize_depyrogenate) prior to use <sup>1</sup>. Wrap your vials and glassware in aluminum foil. Once your oven is at temperature bake for at least 30 minutes. Transfer the still wrapped glassware from the oven directly into your clean room. 

{: .warning }
There is risk of vials breaking in the oven, see dry heat section: https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/homebrew/list/#wiki_sterilization_techniques. Borosilicate vials are not rated to the 500F temp that is needed to depyrogenate. 

Vial caps and stoppers

#TODO list various items that need to be sterilized etc and list how they should do it, have topic pages that explain technique. stoppers and caps MUST be depyrogenated... double check that in CSP. Use USP or WFI water, which can be made in our home lab

If you are using a pressure cooker to sterilize instead of an autoclave you should be sure to read [this page](/topics/instant_pot).

## Fingertip Testing

If you are going to do optional, but encouraged, fingertip testing, now is the time to take the before sample. [How to](/topics/fingertip_testing.md). #TODO
