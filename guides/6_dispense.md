# Filter and Dispense Solution

{: .info }
If you are going to do a final sterility test<sup>+</sup> be sure to supplement the information in this section with the information in the one just below.

{: .warning }
It is easier to break syringe filters than you think. Really. They're difficult to push the preparation through which leads to overcompensation. We **highly** recommend that you practice using a syringe filter and then preform a bubble point test on it to determine if you broke it or not. Do this with a mixture similar to your final preparation (e.g. 2% BA, 44% BB, 54% MCT), just without the hormone component. If you're planning to make a 50mL batch, practice with 50mL. Practice enough so that when you're doing the real thing you can be more confident you're not going to break it. If you break the filter during the real thing all of your medicine will need to be extracted from vials and refiltered.

{: .caution }
Verify what volume of liquid your filters are rated to work on. Do not exceed the manufacturer's recommendation. In general if you're filtering 1-10mL, use a 13mm filter, 10-100mL use a 25mm filter, 100m-250mL use a 33mm filter[^3]. So for example, if you have 25mm syringe filters, and you're filtering 250mL of your preparation, you're going to need to use 3 filters in total. Pushing syringe filters sucks. If you're working with too much preparation for this to be practical consider switching to a [vacuum pump and bottle top filters]. We are unclear on how to conduct DIY [bubble point tests] on bottle top filters.

You should be working inside your still air box or laminar flow hood. Your hands/gloves/etc and everything need to be fully clean. We lightly spray our gloves with IPA 70% and rub together to sanitize.

At this point your glass vials and the vial stoppers should still be wrapped/covered after their depyrogenation/sterilization process.

Attach a large gauge needle to a large,[^1] freshly unwrapped, and sterile syringe. Insert into the mixture and draw it up. With clean hands remove the needle and attach a sterile syringe filter to the syringe and a new, clean, large gauge needle on the end of the filter to help direct the flow successfully into the vials.

Grab a single vial and fill it up with your preparation. Remember that the syringe filter needs to be primed, so it will eat some mixture when filling the first one. Immediately grab a depyrogenated vial stopper and place it on the filled vial.  

Do this for each vial, placing the stopper on each one after filling until you've used up all your mixture. If you have a lab partner they can use the vial capper and put the cap on as soon as the stopper is in place. Otherwise, this can be done by you once all the stoppers are on all vials.

When your syringe needs to be refilled, use a clean hand to unscrew the filter and then draw more mixture into the syringe. Replace the filter and continue to dispense. Never use the needle that you're pushing sterile preparation through to draw back up into the syringe.

## Sterility Test<sup>+</sup>

If you are going to do a final sterility test<sup>+</sup>, you need to determine what total volume of your final preparation[^2] you're going to run the test on.

| Total Volume of Preparation | Volume to Test   |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
| < 1mL                       | 100%             |
| 1-40mL                      | 50%              |
| 40-100mL                    | 20mL             |
| > 100mL                     | 10% (min. 20mL)  |

Any volume you're not using for sterility testing will be filtered directly into vials just like usual. The remaining liquid should be filtered into a sterile flask. Then, using a new sterile syringe, a new sterile filter, and new sterile needles, you draw that fluid back up and **re-filter it**. This second pass filtration can be done with a 0.45μm filter to make it easier, but 0.22μm is okay too if that's all you have.

The 2nd pass can be filtered directly into the vials.

Set aside the 2nd pass filter(s) for now, you will perform the sterility testing on them later. The reasoning is that the 1st pass filter should have collected any contamination, making the 2nd pass filter in theory pointless. If we are unable to grow bacteria off of the 2nd pass filter, then we have validated the efficacy of the 1st pass. This will serve as validation for a sterile, contamination-free batch.

## Cap Vials

Now that all the vials have their stoppers you should place a sterilized vial cap onto each one. Then go around with a crimper (or a makeshift crimper) and seal each one.

This concludes the actual creation of the vials. We will do a couple of extra steps now to ensure safety.

[^1]: use something in the range of 10mL to 50mL. Word has it that the syringe gets more difficult to push the solution through the filter the large the syringe is. We haven't tried it ourselves.
