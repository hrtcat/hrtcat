# Dispense Solution

You should be working inside your still air box or laminar flow hood. Your hands/gloves/etc and everything need to be fully clean.

At this point your glass vials and the vial stoppers should still be wrapped/covered after their depyrogenation process.

Insert a large<sup>*</sup>, freshly unwrapped and sterile syringe, into the mixture and draw it up. With clean hands attach a sterile syringe filter to the syringe and a large gauge needle on the end of the filter to help direct the flow successfully into the vial.

Grab a single vial and fill it up with 5mL of liquid. Remember that the syringe filter needs to be primed, so it will eat some mixture when filling the first one. Immediately grab a depyrogenated vial stopper and place it on the filled vial.  

Do this for each vial, placing the stopper on each one after filling until you've used up all your mixture. 

When your syringe needs to be refilled, use a clean hand to unscrew the filter and then draw more mixture into the syringe. Replace the filter and continue to dispense.

## Cap Vials

Now that all the vials have their stoppers you should place a sterilized vial cap onto each one. Then go around with a crimper (or a makeshift crimper) and seal each one. 

This concludes the actual creation of the vials. We can do a couple extra steps to increase and ensure safety. 

## Fingertip Test

If you are doing [fingertip testing](/topics/fingertip_testing.md) now is the time to take your final sample.

## Notes

<sup>*</sup>use something in the range of 10mL to 50mL. Word has it that the syringe gets more difficult to push the solution through the filter the large the syringe is. I haven't tried it myself.
