# Bubble Point Testing

{: .notice }
**PLEASE** do this step to ensure your preparation is sterile. It requires no additional tools. 

We rely primarily on the syringe filter to ensure sterility of the end product. While people will speak at length about other ways to sterilize DIY brews, filters are the only scientifically validated method of sterilization and depyrogenation of your preparation that are available for you in a DIY lab. 

For this reason **we urge you** to conduct a bubble point test to ensure that your syringe filter maintained integrity throughout your filtration process. Bubble point testing does not require **any** additional tools beyond what you already have on hand, and it takes only a minute to conduct plus some light math that we are going to help you with. This is a test we do on the syringe filter(s) we used to prepare our vials. If you did a 2nd pass filtration for sterility testing **do not** conduct a bubble point test on any 2nd pass filters. 

1. Find the bubble point of your syringe filters, `A`. It should be listed on the package or on the product's webpage.
2. Find the current air pressure at your location using today's weather, convert from [inHg to PSI], `B`.
3. Remove the syringe filter from the syringe you were filling with, and then fill that syringe (or a new one) with air to an exact measurement, `C`, e.g. 10.0mL. Reattach the syringe filter. Attach a large gauge needle to the filter. 
4. Submerge the needle in a cup of tap water. Slowly exert pressure onto the plunger, attempting to push air through the filter. When the needle starts emitting a _steady_ stream of air bubbles record the volume marked on the syringe, `D`.
5. You should have the below values:

`A` - Rated bubble point pressure  
`B` - Current air pressure  
`C` - Starting volume  
`D` - Actual bubble point volume  

Go to the [Boyle's Law Calculator] and input your values. Initial pressure is `B`. Initial volume is `C`. Final volume is `D`. Make sure you're using the correct units of measurement.

The calculator will give you a value for final pressure, call this `E` - actual bubble point

How does the rated bubble point of your filter, `A`, compare to the actual bubble point you calculated? If the actual bubble point is lower than the rated bubble point, you need to ask if your filter failed during filtration. 

For example, if our filter is rated to 86psi, and our actual bubble point was 80psi, we're going to consider the filter functional. It withstood a lot of pressure, and we're working with only estimates here. Laboratory bubble point tests use more sophisticated methods of measurement.

On the other hand, if our filter is rated to 86psi, and our actual bubble point was 50psi, then this is a sign that there was a major failure with the filter during use. We can't guarantee that it did what it was supposed to do for us.

If your filter failed, it might be worth running an experiment on a new filter from the same batch to determine where it's bubble point is (once the filter is saturated in oil). It's (unlikely but) possible the batch was incorrectly labeled

If we determine that our filter failed during use, we will redo all of our work. Working in the still air box or laminar flow hood we will remove all the mixture from all the vials with a syringe and needle. We will use a new syringe and new syringe filter and re-filter everything into NEW sterilized and depyrogenated vials.
