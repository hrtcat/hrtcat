# Creating a Work Area

Creating a clean area where you can minimize the flow of dust particles and bacteria is essential to creating a clean product. 

1. *Find an area* where you can build a small clean room by hanging the plastic sheeting to create makeshift walls. There should be no carpet<sup>1</sup> and nothing in this area that can hold on to bacteria. Ideally in this area there's nothing but the bare floor and the table.
2. *Hang the plastic sheeting.* The clean room does not need to be airtight, but the closest you can get to that the better. There needs to be an opening for a high-powered HEPA air filter to blow into the clean room, and a second opening to act as a doorway.
3. You need a HEPA air purifier blowing air into the clean room, the in-take for the air purifier should be coming from outside the clean room, so as to create a pressurized environment<sup>2</sup> inside of the clean room.
4. #TODO the table in your clean room needs to be able to be sanitized, wood is not a good candidate for this, you can lay plastic sheeting down on your table in order to create a work surface that can be sanitized.
5. Clean the clean room. Everything in here should be free of dust dirt grime, and sanitized. Keep the HEPA purifier running.
