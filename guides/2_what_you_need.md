# What You'll Need

## Ingredients

* Your hormone ester of choice at [verified concentration](/topics/verify_concentration). ([How to order](/topics/ordering_raws))
* Carrier oil, MCT seems to be preferred in DIY community [(how to choose)](/topics/choosing_oil)
* Benzo alcohol, a preservative

## Vials

* 5mL glass vials (do not use larger to avoid over puncturing)
* Vial caps

OR

* Pre-sterilized and sealed 5mL glass vials. Only use these if you're making a single vial at a time as it must be punctured to fill, thus accelerating expiration. The use of pre-sterilized and sealed vials substantially lowers risk of contamination, assuming the vials are finished within a couple months of filling.

* Isopropyl alcohol 70% (IPA)
* Disinfecting hand soap

## Tools

* Autoclave/pressure cooker [(I use an Instant Pot)](/topics/instant_pot)
* Miligram scale
* Glass media containers for mixing
* Vial crimper
* Still air box*
* HEPA Air filtration*
* Laminar flow hood*
* Plastic sheeting for creating a makeshift clean room*
* Incubator for sterility tests* ([DIY solutions](https://labincubators.net/blogs/blog/how-to-make-a-lab-incubator))
* Bubble point tester*

## Garbs

* Face masks
