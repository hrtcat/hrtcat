# What You'll Need

## Ingredients

* Your hormone ester of choice, [tested](/topics/hormone_testing). ([How to order](/topics/ordering_raws))
* MCT oil, or other carrier oil [(read more)](/topics/choosing_oil)
* Benzyl alcohol, a preservative
* Benzyl benzoate, a solvent

## Vials

* 5mL glass vials (do not use larger to avoid over use)
* Vial caps 
* Silicone vial stoppers (needs to be silicone for home depyrogenation)

OR

* Pre-sterilized and sealed 5mL glass vials. Only use these if you're making a single vial at a time as it must be punctured to fill, thus accelerating expiration. The use of pre-sterilized and sealed vials substantially lowers risk of contamination, assuming the vials are finished within a couple months of filling. This guide will not touch on this subject further as the focus here is bulk.

## Disposables

* Large sterile luer lock syringes (10mL? more? #TODO)
* Sterile 0.22Î¼m PVDF syringe filters [(how to choose)](/topics/choosing_filter)
* Agar plates* (for [fingertip testing](/topics/fingertip_testing)) ([how to make at home](/topics/make_agar))
* [Biologocal indicators](/topics/biological_indicators.md)* (currently out of scope)
* Isopropyl alcohol 70% (IPA) (higher percentage is NOT better, use 70%)
* Disinfecting hand soap
* Aluminum foil

## Tools

* Autoclave ([I use an Instant Pot](/topics/instant_pot), though a stove top pressure cooker would likely work too)
* Milligram scale
* Glass media containers/beakers for mixing
* Glass stirring rod
* Vial crimper
* Table that can be sanitized to work on (don't work directly on wood)
* Oven that reaches 200C
  *  Oven thermometer to verify temps in your oven
* Baking sheet/tray/dish
* Spray bottle for the IPA
* HEPA Air purifier*
* [Laminar flow hood](/topics/diy_laminar)* OR a [still air box](/topics/still_air)*
* Plastic sheeting for creating a makeshift clean room*
* Incubator for sterility tests* ([DIY solutions](https://labincubators.net/blogs/blog/how-to-make-a-lab-incubator))

## Garbs

* Face masks
* Latex or Nitrile gloves, ideally sterile
* Long sleeve gown with wrist cinches (if unavailable, use freshly laundered item that is put on just before entering the clean room)
* Shoe covers
* Hair covers (includes facial hair)

*highly recommended for sterility purposes but often skipped in DIY brews. try to do as many of these as you can.
