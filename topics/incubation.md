# Incubation

## Sterility testing  

Filter membranes that are on SCDM/TSA growth medium need to be incubated at 20-25째C (68-77째F) for 14 days.[^1] Our makeshift lab space stays consistently in this temperature range, so for TSA plates we will not be using an incubator.

Membranes on FTM growth medium need to be incubated at 30-35째C (86-95째F) for 14 days.[^1]

Batches should remain in quarantine until the sterility test results are back.
