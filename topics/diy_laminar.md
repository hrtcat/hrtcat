# DIY Laminar Flow Hood

These things are pretty expensive to buy out right, but they can be built for substantially less money at home. As usual this comes with a sacrifice in quality. If you decide to forego the flow hood, please do use a [still air box](/topics/still_air).

I already had 2 Honeywell HPA300 air purifiers, so I decided to use one of them to try to build a laminar flow hood at home.

There's a variety of videos that can show you how to do this, I'm linking one below

I like this video because it demonstrates how this is good, but it's not trying to pretend that it's perfect. That seems to be how a lot of this works, we shouldn't expect any one of our safety measures to be perfect. But if we stack enough of them up on top of each other, we can have a reasonable certainty that we have successfully created a sterile product.

A friend describe it to me like Swiss cheese. With any single slice there are holes in it that you can see through. But if you take enough of those slices and stack them up on top of each other eventually you have a solid chunk of cheese.
