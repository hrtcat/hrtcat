# Bulk Filtration

You can use a vacuum pump and a bottle filter in order to have a more efficient version of the syringe filter. This is a common methodology used in the bodybuilding community when making large numbers of vials. If you are producing in bulk, either for mutual aid or for sale, you may want to invest in this equipment. 

I don't have more info to share on this at the moment as it's not something I've researched or that I am planning to use in the near future. If I wanted to learn more about this I would probably start by reading the wiki page on r/steroids [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/homebrew/list/).
