# Recipes

We have no firm opinions on the recipes listed below except that we would be hesitant of any concentration of any hormone ester that would make your vial last more than a couple months.<sup>††</sup>.

<sup>*</sup>Part of MCT oil. A good pharmaceutical grade MCT oil will list the percentage each of C8 and C10

## Recipes used by drug manufacturers

These recipes are listed to help us understand how these drugs are formulated at the highest levels of the pharmaceutical industry. Surprise! It's basically done the same way that homebrewers do it.

{: .caution }
Some recipes list ingredients in different units of measurement. Look out for `mg` vs `mL` and use the above table to convert

## Notes

<sup>†</sup>[Chlorobutanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorobutanol) is a preservative, and as far as we can tell does not act as a solvent. We will use benzyl alcohol instead of this primarily because it is much more readily available, and that's what all the other homebrewers do. If you decide to brew with this stuff make sure you check through all the MSDS to ensure its safe to be handling outside a lab. 

<sup>††</sup>While it's cool to have a single vial last you for a year, as soon as you start puncturing a vial you should aim to use it within a couple of months. When you use it over and over again you risk introducing harmful bacteria to the vial, and then giving it time to grow.
