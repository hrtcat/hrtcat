# Still Air Boxes

Take a large, clear tupperware container. Cut two holes in one side for your hands and arms to fit through. You will use it by having it upside down on the tabletop and sticking your arms through it, doing _all_ of your sterile work inside. It will vastly minimize your shit being hit by random microbes flying around your clean room. 

This is a very common thing in the home mycology community. Look this up on youtube and you'll find some good info on how to build/use.

#TODO - flesh out, link more info
