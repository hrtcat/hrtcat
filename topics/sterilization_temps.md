# Sterilization Temperatures

## Dry Heat

### Static air

Dry heat sterilization using a static-air sterilizer (basically an oven) is not suitable for most materials. Use 338F for 60 mins, 320F for 120 mins, or 302F for 150 mins<sup>1</sup>. If using a kitchen oven there should be a thermometer inside to verify temperatures, as the temperature you set it to is not a reliable indicator as to the temperature inside the oven.

| Temperature | Time     |
|:------------|:---------|
| 180C        | 30 mins  |
| 338F/170C   | 60 mins  |
| 320F/160C   | 120 mins |
| 302F        | 150 mins |

| Temperature | Time     |
|:------------|:---------|
| 250C        | 30 mins  |
| 200C        | 60 mins  |

### Forced Air

See USP Chapter 797 for these details. Will not be filled in here as I am unlikely to use this method.

## Steam / Autoclave

Considered an "advanced" compounding procedure. Consult USP Chapter 1211.

This is the use of an autoclave. Commercially available pressure cookers such as stovetop units and the electric Instant Pot can be used here, but understanding how they pressurize is vitally important.

**121C at 15psi for 20-60 minutes**<sup>1</sup>. The time varies based on the specific CSP. I'm currently unclear how to determine this. When in doubt I will always go longer.

#TODO revise above, add info about F<sub>0</sub>, Z, D.

See the [instant pot](/topics/instant_pot) page for data about sterilization with that.

See [this page](/other/lena) for info about sterilizing sealed containers.
