# Alcohol Sanitization Technique

#TODO, flesh out, find resources. There's surely a good video from the mycology community about this on youtube.

make a spray bottle filled with isopropyl alcohol 70% (don't get stronger) spray your hands and the items you're working with as needed in order to sanitize. Don't spray anything that you've already sterilized. Essentially you can use this to wipe down anything that might have bacteria on it, including your still air box or flow hood.
