# Choosing Syringe Filters

* **Pore Size**: 0.22Î¼m (this size is required for sterilization)
* **Sterility**: Use pre-packaged, sterile filters.
* **Size**: if you're filtering 1-10mL, use a 13mm filter. 10-100mL use a 25mm filter<sup>1</sup>. Keep in mind that the filter will eat some of your final product. The larger the filter the more product it will retain. At the same time, a larger filter will be easier to push your preparation through. I use 33mm, as ease of use is more important to me than the wasted product.
* **Filter material**: Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) is highly available and is compatible with our goals. It is safe with oil, benzyl alcohol, and benzyl benzoate (in small quantities).

Make sure the filters you are purchasing list a bubble point on them. We need to do a bubble point test after terminal sterilization to ensure that the filter kept its integrity. I've seen it also listed as "Max Burst Pressure."
