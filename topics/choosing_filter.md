# Choosing Syringe Filters

{: .warning }
This page previously recommended PVDF filters. Do not use these. After further research we discovered that we received a bad recommendation. There is insufficient data about the interactions between benzyl benzoate and PDVF. Combining BB with PDVF may result in filter degradation and failure. Instead **use PTFE filters**. PTFE has studied compatibility with BA, BB, and organically derived oils.

* **Pore Size**: 0.22Î¼m (this size is required for sterilization)
* **Sterility**: Use pre-packaged, sterile filters.
* **Size**: if you're filtering 1-10mL, use a 13mm filter. 10-100mL use a 25mm filter[^1]. 100m-250mL use a 33mm filter[^4]. Keep in mind that the filter will eat some of your final product. The larger the filter the more product it will retain. At the same time, a larger filter will be easier to push your preparation through.
* **Filter material**: Hydrophilic Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is moderately available and is compatible with our goals. It is safe with oil, benzyl alcohol, and benzyl benzoate.[^2] [^3]

Make sure the filters you are purchasing list a bubble point on them. We need to do a bubble point test after terminal sterilization to ensure that the filter kept its integrity. We've seen it also listed as "Max Burst Pressure." You can also preform a test on a spare filter to find the bubble point yourself.
