# Biological Indicators

Biological Indicators (BIs) are a safety verification technique required to be used in compounding pharmacies around the world. They contain microbes that are typically very resistant to death-by-autoclave. They are used by lab techs verify that their equipment is operating as expected. You would put the BI into the autoclave and run it at the desired settings. After it's finished you incubate the BI, and it will change colors if your autoclave did not successfully kill off the microbes inside. 

It would be really cool to have access to these for our home labs, especially those of us using pressure cooker autoclaves. Unfortunately I've only been able to find them to be purchased in bulk, and they're not cheap.

This will remain a "wishlist" item for now.
