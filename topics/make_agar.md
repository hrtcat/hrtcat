# How to Make Agar Plates

DIY mycologists love this shit so there's tons of guides available. I have previously used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pqJxFpsE84) that gave me excellent results. Make sure you're pouring in a still air box/clean room/laminar flow hood.

I'm sure there's lots of other good guide available. 

Make sure you can make good agar and that you're confident in it before you try use it to do [fingertip testing](/topics/fingertip_testing).
