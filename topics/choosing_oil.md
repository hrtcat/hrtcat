# Choosing a Carrier Oil

#TODO clean up this page

Most legal compounding pharmacies use castor oil because it's one of the most studied carriers<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.

MCT is more viscous and so absorption rate is quicker<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.

MCT is the standard in homebrewing, both with HRT and the steroid communities. I can't track down why exactly this is. Possibly because it's easier to inject than castor and less people are allergic to MCT. Anecdotally it's used enough that I consider it safe and likely the right move to use this. If you want to go more by-the-book you can try castor, cottonseed, grapeseed, or sesame. I recommend if you stray from MCT you have data backing up your decision, which you should then send to me so I can include it here.

This is like the MCT oil listed [here](https://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/catalog/product/view/id/24082/s/mct-60-40-caprylic-c8-capric-c10-oil/category/2316/), which is also listed as pharmaceutical grade. I haven't researched the C8/C10 thing, but I will say that you def should get pharma grade if you can.
