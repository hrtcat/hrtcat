# Bubble Point Testing

Your syringe filter will be rated to filter a maximum volume of liquid, and will also list a specific bubble point. The bubble point is the amount of pressure needed to push air through an already wet syringe filter. Your syringe's bubble point will be listed in PSI, bar, atm, or some other unit that measures pressure.

Bubble point testing is performed after you use the filter in order to verify that the filter held its integrity throughout the filtration process. If it turns out that the bubble point is less than what the manufacturer says it should be, then that indicates that the filter failed somewhere in the middle of you using it.

There are three ways to do bubble point testing ([video](https://www.sartorius.com/en/products/lab-filtration-purification/syringe-filters/bubble-point-test)).
1. With a large syringe (10mL+) and some simple math
2. Using a specialty pressure gauge hooked up to the syringe and filter
3. Using an electronic pressure gauge

While method 1 has the lowest accuracy of the three methods, we will be using this one as it requires no additional equipment.

There's lots of ways you can do this, but using a large syringe and inputting some values into a [Boyle's Law calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/boyles-law) will help us get high quality results for this test without buying any fancy equipment.
